## Road Accident Data Modeling and Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes road traffic collision data to uncover trends in collisions, fatalities, injuries,
and high-risk conditions. The dashboard demonstrates data modeling process, DAX, and storytelling capabilities using Power BI.

## Objective
This project aims to:
* Compare accident outcomes across counties.
* Analyze differences between collision volume and fatality risk.
* Explore monthly trends in injuries and fatality rates.
* Identify vehicle types associated with higher death rates.
* Demonstrate end-to-end BI development skills.

## Dataset
* Type: Simulated data
* Geography: Selected Kenyan counties
* Time Period: 2025
* Key Fields: Date, County, Vehicle Type, Collisions, Injuries, Time of Day

## Tools & Technologies
* Power BI
* Power Query
* DAX
* Star Schema Msodeling
* Data Visualization

## Data Simulation
The simulation script generates:
* Road traffic collision records
* Fatalities (deaths) and injuries
* Temporal features (date, month, year)
* Intentional missing values for realism
  Simulation Script:
  https://github.com/Moseslwanda2018/Data-Engineering/blob/main/simulated%20collisions%20data.R
[`simulated_collision_data.R`](scripts/https://github.com/Moseslwanda2018/Data-Engineering/blob/main/simulated%20collisions%20data.R)

## Data Model
* The model follows a star schema design:

## Fact table:
* fact_collisions
## Dimension tables:
* dim_date
* dim_location
* dim_vehicle_type
* dim_time_of_day
* dim_lighting_condition
## This structure enables efficient filtering, aggregation, and scalable analysis.

## Dashboard Features
* A combo chart showing monthly injuries alongside fatality rate trends
* A combo chart highlighting differences in fatality risk among vehicle types
* A combo chart highlighting the fatality risk differences at different times of the day
* Clustered bar chart comparing collisions, injuries, and deaths by county
* KPI cards summarizing the overall accident impact
* DAX-based metrics for dynamic calculations like total collisions, injuries, deaths, and death rate

## Y-Axis Choice
Collision, injury, and death counts are displayed on a primary Y-axis starting at zero to preserve magnitude with death rate (%) plotted on a secondary axis with various ranges for meaningful risk differences visible without distorting comparisons.

## Key Insights
* Time of day significantly affects fatalility risk with time night collisions being disproportionately severe.
* Counties with similar collision volumes can experience very different fatality outcomes.
* In the simulation, fatality rates remain consistently above 20% throughout the year.
* Certain vehicle types show higher death rates despite comparable collision counts.

## Future Improvements
* Add predictive analytics
* Include weather and road conditions.
